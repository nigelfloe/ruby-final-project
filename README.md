About
A command line has been created through the Yelp website API. The interactive
command line has been built with a Ruby Object oriented language as a backbone.
The user could input an address, city, or a zip code to begin the search. The
search proceeds with asking for a category of a business and prompts with a
listing of the businesses with name, addresses and telephone number.
